The fairness p of the coin toss can be derived by the mean # of searches in a session - which can be a configurable parameter (how search-smart the user is).\n\nGiven the model above the function's primary parameter (# of searches per day) can be used together with the poisson derived # of session to determine the # of sessions in the day. Due to time potential overlap a session is not guaranteed to finish - the user may \"jump\" to sth else.\n\nThe function allows for timezone offset, as well as a parameter that can be used to determine the day of the week (e.g. weekday vs weekend behavior variation)\n\nModel defaults\n```\nvar defaults = {\n  weekday_start_hour : [9,0.3], // normal 9am mean sigma 0.3\n  weekday_end_hour : [18,0.3], // normal 6pm mean sigma 0.3\n  weekend_start_hour : [10,0.4], // normal 10am mean sigma 0.4\n  weekend_end_hour : [21,0.4], // normal 9pm mean sigma 0.4\n  weekend_sessions : 8, // poisson lambda 8\n  searches_in_session : 4, // bernoulli p=0.25 => mean tosses 1/p => 4\n  search_interval : [30,5] // normal 30secs mean sigma 5 secs\n}\n\n```\n\nParameters:\n```\n/*\n *  @total approximate rate of searches per day\n *  @when  timestamp for which date should be used - leave null for now \n *  @tz_offset  if human at east coast GMT-5 and server at west coast GMT-8 then tzoffset=3\n *  @opts overrides defaults hash above\n */\nmodule.exports = function(total,when,tz_offset,opts) {\n```\n\n## Installation \n\nInstalling the module\n\n    npm install humanlike\n\n",
